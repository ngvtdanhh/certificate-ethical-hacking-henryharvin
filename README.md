## 📝 Course Review

This course offers a practical overview of ethical hacking tools, phases, and tactics. Though designed for beginners, it still touches on relevant techniques used by modern Red Team professionals.

✅ **What I liked**:
- Broad coverage of both network and application attacks  
- Simple language and beginner-friendly structure  
- Includes both theory and some practice-oriented examples

📌 **To Improve**:
- Lack of true lab environments or VM practice  
- Some sections could use updated tools or attack chains
