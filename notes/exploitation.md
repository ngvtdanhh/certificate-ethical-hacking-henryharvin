# 💥 Exploitation

In this phase, the attacker leverages known vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code.

## 🧰 Techniques

- **Web Exploits** – SQLi, XSS, file inclusion
- **System Exploits** – Buffer overflows, privilege escalation
- **Metasploit** – Framework for automated exploitation

## 🔍 Example Process

1. Identify vulnerability
2. Select exploit
3. Configure payload
4. Launch and verify access

## 🧠 Caution

- Always test in isolated lab environments
- Do not exploit real systems without consent
